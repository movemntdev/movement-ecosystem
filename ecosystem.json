These fees can be allocated towards various purposes based on each individual team's needs and financial model. Baptswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) model, where users can trade against a liquidity pool of two assets, rather than an order book of buy and sell orders. Liquidity providers can earn fees by depositing their tokens into the pool, and traders can swap any token pair supported by the protocol.

Anyone to launch their own perpetual futures market of their own token (benefical to the project tokens to attract traders) and/or  2. Anyone to launch perpetual futures market using their own tokens (benefits the ecosystem as it increase token utility for all tokens in the ecosystem)",

In the rapidly evolving world, and web, it is becoming less efficient to simply trust and more crucial to verify everything.  Sign Protocol offers a suite of tools, infrastructure, and standards to create a future where all claims and assertions on the web and the world around us are driven by verifiable attestations. It does this by leveraging modern technologies, such as decentralized blockchains and data storage solutions, along with novel techniques such as the use of zero-knowledge cryptography and digital signatures.",

Professor Tse is a member of the U.S. Academy of Engineering. He is renowned as the inventor of the legendary proportional-fair scheduling algorithm for wireless communications, and is the recipient of prestigious awards such as the IEEE Claude E. Shannon Award and the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world. Babylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: its asset, its reliable timestamping service, and its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.",
